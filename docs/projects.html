                                        <p>Navigation is a technique which basically focuses on process of monitoring and controlling 
                                           the movement of person or vehicle or craft from one place to another e.g.: Land navigation, 
                                            Marine Navigation, Aeronautic Navigation etc. The campus navigator is the android mobile 
                                            application which is basically used for navigating routes inside any campus premises e.g. 
                                            Library, College, dorm, Hospital   etc... Mobile phones are nowadays far more than merely 
                                            devices to communicate with. Especially, Smartphone’s are products that help to make our 
                                            work and everyday life easier.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> A long with the advance in technology and popularity of these devices, the use of mobile 
                                            applications has increased enormously in the last few years, based on new techniques like 
                                            GPS that can used to determine the location of the device. There are several commercial 
                                            navigation applications - such as Google Maps, Yahoo Maps and Map quest that provide users 
                                            with directions from one place to another. However, these applications must search along
                                            existing roads; they are not able to provide routes that are as precise as an on-campus 
                                            path would require.So, this project focused on developing android based navigation system 
                                            which will help new comers navigate through the campus without the help on any body’s 
                                            help with ease  and short amount of time.
                                          </p>

                                        <ul>  
                                            <li>The application used to locate the current location of the mobile device more precisely, 
                                                the user’s current location can be used to show him nearby points of interest and help 
                                                him to get know the campus. </li>
                                            <li>It track or navigate the direction for user to move on the campus until the user reach 
                                                the destination effectively and efficiently. I.e. outdoor path finding.</li>
                                            <li>It reduces the effort of the user to walk all over the campus </li>
                                            <li>It used to show nearly the 3D map of the campus(i.e. building with its information, 
                                                route) I.e. used to browsing the map </li>
                                            <li>It displays the user's progress along the route and issues instructions for each turn. </li>
                                            <li>It gives the shortest and proper path to reach the destination. </li>
                                            <li>It tells the direction, distance and expected time to reach the destination more precisely</li>
                                            <li>It gives silent navigation mode (invisible mode).On long walking parts of the route there is 
                                                no need to look permanently on the device. Especially more experienced users do not need to 
                                                look at the map and the navigation descriptions all the time. That is why there should be 
                                                invisible navigation mode which is more passive.   This mode – the invisible mode – is 
                                                activated when the user turns off his display. He can put his mobile device in his pocket 
                                                and still gets notifications. </li> </ul>
